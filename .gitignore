# Android specific ignores (within the 'android' folder, but common to list here)
# These are internal Android build and configuration files that should not be committed.
# Many of these are already covered by ignoring 'android/' entirely,
# but it's good to list explicit patterns for clarity or if 'android/' isn't fully ignored.
